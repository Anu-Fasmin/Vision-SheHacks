     <p5><i>I believe 'SheHacks' will be a great opportunity to learn, explore, discover, and network for a brighter future. It gives us a chance to meet and collaborate with new peoples who have the same interests and skills.
          This creates the perfect environment for networking. It is a fantastic learning opportunity to learn a new skill and attaining new knowledge. We might gain more knowledge than we would in six months, due to the learning-by-doing approach.
          As we are working as a team, it will help us to get out of our comfort zone, improve social skills, share ideas and grow.We can soak up information from fellow attendees â€” including ideas we may never have gained in the classroom or from a book.</p5></i>

      <p5><i>I think 'SheHacks' is a golden opportunity to learn programming for beginners. I believe, through this workshop i can improve my programming skills and networking. I wanna learn programming and gain technical as well as non technical skills.
         This program provides a very good opportunity for participants to network with people from different backgrounds having same interest and learn new skills. This kind of workshops will enable us to think logically, work effectively and increase our creativity level.
         And this is a teamwork, which gives a chance on taking lead on some tasks, sharing our know-how, and dealing with different personalities which will be useful for our career. I hope we can explore the 'great world of programming' and enjoy through out the program.</p5></i>

     <p5><i>My vision and mission for 'SheHacks' are simple: Connect with people to learn about the topics of interest and make important decisions. I'm always looking forward to expanding my network, so this is a great choice.
            I believe that 'SheHacks' provides a stable work environment with equal opportunity for learning and personal growth. And I hope me and my teammates to be able to work and explore more skills that are useful to our career.
            This means we would enjoy this program and learn a lot from it.</p5></i>
